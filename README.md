Hello Ondrej, so for the final submission I didn't want to just do all the assignments, so I looked through the list of references/tutorials you put on here. I choose this game because I thought it would be possible to connect it to the raspberry pico (which I did not do, but I imagine it being playable with a little controller > button, or that you need to move your hand in order to shoot the laser). But yeah, I wanted to do the game and then change the shape a little bit (shoot hearts not lasers.) Unfortunately I have no idea if the code is really working since my laptop is so full (the ram) that it wouldn't execute. 
I hope it works, fixed all the typos and such...
